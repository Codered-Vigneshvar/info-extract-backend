You are extracting label information from a product/package image.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY a single valid JSON object
- No markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
- No explanations before or after the JSON
- No additional text or commentary
- The response must start with { and end with }

FIELDS TO EXTRACT:
Extract these fields only if clearly visible in the image:
1. package_name - Full product/package name as printed on label
2. brand_name - Brand or manufacturer name
3. mfg_date - Manufacturing date (preserve exact format as shown)
4. exp_date - Expiry/Best Before/Use By date (preserve exact format as shown)
5. net_quantity - Net quantity/weight/volume including units (e.g., "500g", "1L")
6. mrp_price - MRP or price with currency symbol if present (e.g., "₹50")
7. batch_lot_no - Batch number, Lot number, or Code number

FIELD STRUCTURE:
Each field must return:
{
  "value": string or null,
  "confidence": number between 0.0 and 1.0,
  "evidence": array of exact text snippets from the image
}

CONFIDENCE SCORING RULES (BE STRICT):
- 0.95-1.0: Text is crystal clear, perfectly legible, unambiguous, and complete
- 0.85-0.94: Text is clearly visible with only minor imperfections (slight blur/shadow)
- 0.70-0.84: Text is readable but has moderate issues (faded, small, partially obscured)
- 0.50-0.69: Text is barely readable or requires significant inference
- Below 0.50: Set value to null instead - text is too unclear

ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (CRITICAL):
1. NEVER invent or guess information not visible in the image
2. NEVER use typical/common values as substitutes for missing data
3. NEVER reformat dates or values - preserve exactly as shown
4. If text is unclear or ambiguous, use lower confidence OR set to null
5. Evidence array must contain EXACT text snippets from image, not descriptions
6. If you cannot find clear evidence for a field, set value to null
7. Do not use prior knowledge about products to fill in missing information

ADDITIONAL FIELD:
Include one additional field:
- raw_text_guess: string containing best-effort transcription of ALL visible text on the package

REMEMBER: 
- Output must be valid, parseable JSON only
- Be conservative with confidence scores
- Never fabricate information
- Set value to null when uncertain rather than guessing
